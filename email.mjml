            Google launches Gallery Go, a lightweight gallery app.</span><br /><br />

        <mj-text width="100%" vertical-align="middle" color="grey" font-size="16px">We are without a doubt thankful to Google Photos that it lets us save so many images and videos on the cloud and that too for as long as we want. That is certainly a good option when we have storage limitations on our devices. We don't have to
          go through all the trouble of transferring media manually while switching devices. However we must admit, it is a heavy app.</mj-text>

        Gallery Go, launched recently by Google , comes in small file size which means even more space for our own photos. All while using less memory on our device - so it wont slow down our phone. It is also well optimised to work offline. It's fast, smart
        and has light photos and a video gallery build up by google. It enables automatic reorganization, each night gallery go will automatically reorganize our photos to group by:- people,selfies,nature,animals, document,videos and movies. Gallery go
        helps us to stay organised, so we can spend less time scrolling for for any photo of friends or family members, and more time sharing memories with them. It also enables auto enhancing properties which will make our photos look their best with
        one - tap. Use of folders to organise photos to anyway we want. All while still being able to view,copy and transfer to and from sd cards easily. So, it can be a good replacement for Google Photos.</mj-text>

            Rainforest Connection: The only connection involving an outdated smartphone

        <mj-text width="100%" vertical-align="middle" color="grey" font-size="16px">Making use of cutting edge technology to solve both local and global crisis is something that is not alien to any of us, and neither are we that naive so as to not realize the detrimental impact our day to day practices are bringing upon the environment.<br
          /><br /> But what if we told you, it's not some contemporary or modern machinery, but your out of date smartphone that can help save hectares of crucial rainforests that are home to about 80% of our land based animal and plant species? <br /><br
          />As illegal logging in the rainforests continues to thrive and has become one of the leading contributors to deforestation and widespread loss of not only habitats but full fledged eco systems in the recent years; a non profit named 'Rainforest
          Connection' has come to the rescue with a simple yet groundbreaking idea of using recycled, rewired smartphones to detect the sounds of illegal logging which was earlier difficult amidst the hubbub of rivers , waterfalls and other forest animals.
          <br /><br />The old smartphones the organization receives are rewired and fitted with an extra microphone before being placed on trees ,where they draw energy from solar panels and can detect sounds in nearly over a mile long radius. <br /><br
          />The founder, Topher White , also developed an algorithm that helps distinguish a chainsaw's din from other forest noises. Once the chainsaw noise is detected, the program sends out alerts to on duty park rangers, who can then catch the violators
          in the act.<br /> <br /> Rainforest Connection claims that a single rewired phone could protect over a square mile of an endangered forest, that has the same environmental impact as the taking out of over 3000 vehicles off the road for over
          a year. <br /><br />Conservation of our forests is the need of the hour, and the initial success of Rainforest Connection shows that one can always do their part, be it something as trivial as donating your outdated smartphone.</mj-text>

        <mj-text width="100%" vertical-align="middle" color="grey" font-size="16px">You are able to read this newsletter because you have a smartphone right now. It has become a basic need for every human being along with food, clothes and shelter. You will be having around 5-6 smartphones in your family even though you don't
          require all of it. It is so common that people change their smartphones frequently as they like being up to date with technology.<br /><br /> It is observed nowadays that the present generation spends their time on smartphones. You will not
          be too surprised to find small children of the age 3-4 using smartphones way better than their parents. They don’t know how to communicate but can still operate phones way better than their grandparents.<br /><br /> Teens, for instance, use
          it during their leisure time to browse through social media like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, playing games, YouTube etc. They get too engrossed into their devices that they lose their focus and avoid playing outdoor games which leads to health
          issues. While studying, they get distracted as to what is happening on Instagram, etc. which leads to lower grades.<br /><br /> It is not bad to possess a smartphone but it's not right to rely on them completely. It is important to use them
          only for necessary purposes in order to avoid falling into it.</mj-text>
